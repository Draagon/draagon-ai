# FitCoach AI - Pitch for Mike

**From:** Doug
**Date:** December 2025
**TL;DR:** Let's build an AI fitness coaching platform together. You bring the expertise and trainer network, I build the tech. Your 34K followers become paying clients, and you become the gatekeeper of an elite trainer network across Asia.

---

## The Opportunity in 30 Seconds

The AI fitness coaching market is exploding - $10B today, $46B by 2030. Asia Pacific is growing fastest at 28% annually. There's a massive gap in the market: apps like Fitbod are $15/month but have no human touch. Live personal training is $150-200/month but doesn't scale.

**The gap:** Nobody owns the $49-79/month async video review tier - where real trainers review recorded movements and give personalized feedback.

You already have the audience (34K Instagram, growing fast in Asia). You have the expertise (Animal Flow, movement-based training). You have the credibility.

What you don't have is a way to serve 1,000 clients without working 200 hours a week.

**That's where this comes in.**

---

## What We're Building

An AI fitness coach that sounds like you, thinks like you, and coaches like you - but works 24/7 for unlimited clients while you sleep.

### The Tech (My Part)
- AI personality system that captures your coaching style
- Memory that remembers each client's goals, injuries, limitations, progress
- Smart recommendations based on your methodology
- Mobile app with your video library
- Video review system for async human feedback

### The Business (Your Part)
- Your coaching philosophy turned into AI
- Your voice, your style, your approach
- You review video submissions and give real feedback (async, on your schedule)
- You recruit and screen other trainers who want to use the platform
- You're the face, the curator, the quality gatekeeper

## Revenue Tiers

| Tier | Price | What Client Gets | Your Involvement |
|------|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **AI Only** | $29/mo | AI coach + video library | Zero |
| **Video Review** | $59/mo | AI + async video feedback from trainer | 5-10 min per client/week |
| **Hybrid** | $129/mo | AI + weekly video review + chat access | 15-20 min per client/week |
| **Premium** | $249/mo | Everything + priority + live sessions | Your call |

### Why This Works for You

**Today:** You can serve maybe 20-30 personal training clients. You're capped by hours in your day.

**With FitCoach AI:**
- 500 AI-only clients at $29 = $14,500/mo (zero time from you)
- 100 Video Review clients at $59 = $5,900/mo (~8-16 hrs/week of video reviews)
- 30 Hybrid clients at $129 = $3,870/mo (~8 hrs/week)
- 10 Premium clients at $249 = $2,490/mo (your high-touch clients)

**Total:** $26,760/month from 640 clients, with maybe 25-30 hours of actual work.

That's $321K/year with flexible hours, mostly async work you can do from anywhere.

## The Elite Trainer Network (The Real Play)

Here's where it gets interesting. Once this works for you, you become the gatekeeper for other trainers.

### How It Works

1. **You recruit trainers** - Start with your connections in Asia
2. **You screen for quality** - Only the best get in
3. **They use your platform** - Set up their own AI persona, upload their videos
4. **You take a cut** - 20-30% of their revenue

### Trainer Tiers

| Tier | Revenue Share | What They Get |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Licensed Trainers** | 30% to Mike | Your methodology, your brand endorsement |
| **Affiliate Trainers** | 20% to Mike | Platform access, independent brand |
| **Independent** | $99-199/mo flat | Platform only, no network benefits |

### The Math Gets Wild

If you recruit 20 trainers each doing $5K/month:
- 20 trainers × $5K × 25% average = **$25K/month passive** to you

If you recruit 50 trainers:
- 50 trainers × $5K × 25% = **$62.5K/month passive**

This is on top of your own coaching revenue.

## Why Asia First

You're already blowing up there. The timing is perfect:

- Asia Pacific fitness app market: $2B now → $18.9B by 2033
- 28% annual growth (fastest in the world)
- Less saturated than US market
- Your existing presence gives us a head start
- Recruit Asian trainers who know their local markets

---

## What I Need From You

1. **Your brain** - 2-3 sessions to capture your coaching philosophy
2. **Your videos** - Access to your exercise library
3. **Your voice** - Audio samples for AI personality training
4. **Your network** - Intro to trainers who might want in
5. **Your time** - ~5 hrs/week once we launch for video reviews and trainer calls

### What I Do

- Build the entire tech platform (I have AI framework ready)
- Handle all the engineering and deployment
- Set up payment processing and trainer payouts
- Build the mobile app
- Handle support and operations

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **MVP** | 4-6 weeks | AI coach with your personality, basic app, video review |
| **Beta** | 4 weeks | Test with 20-30 of your existing followers |
| **Launch** | Week 10-12 | Open to your full audience |
| **Trainer Network** | Month 4+ | Start recruiting other trainers |

---

## Money

### Startup Costs
- Nearly zero. I'm building this with my own tools
- Only costs: App store fees ($100/yr), server hosting (~$150-550/mo to start)
- No investors needed unless we want to accelerate marketing

### Revenue Split (You and Me)

| Revenue Source | Your Cut | My Cut |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Your direct coaching (AI + human) | 70% | 30% |
| Your trainer network revenue share | You keep it all | Built into platform |
| Platform fees from independent trainers | 50% | 50% |

**Year 1 realistic:** $300-500K combined revenue
**Year 3 with trainer network:** $2-5M combined revenue

## Why This Works

### For Your Clients
- 24/7 access to a coach that knows them
- Affordable entry point ($29/mo vs $200 for live training)
- Real human feedback when they need it
- Your proven methodology, not generic workouts

### For You
- Unlimited scale without unlimited hours
- Income while you sleep (AI tier)
- Flexible async work (video reviews)
- Build an empire, not just a practice
- Passive revenue from trainer network

### For the Market
- Fills the gap between cheap apps and expensive trainers
- Video review tier doesn't exist at scale
- Asia-first is uncontested territory
- Elite/curated positioning vs open marketplaces

---

## The Differentiator

**Most fitness apps:** Generic AI, no personality, algorithmic recommendations

**Most trainer platforms:** Just scheduling and payment tools, trainer does all the work

**FitCoach AI:** Your actual coaching intelligence encoded into AI, augmented by real human review when needed, scaled through a curated network of trainers you personally vet.

The AI isn't replacing you. It's multiplying you.

---

## Competition Check

| Competitor | What They Do | Gap We Fill |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Future** ($150/mo) | Human coach via app | Too expensive, US-focused |
| **Fitbod** ($13/mo) | AI workout generation | No personality, no human touch |
| **Caliber** ($200+/mo) | Premium human coaching | Doesn't scale, US-focused |
| **Trainerize** | Trainer platform | Tool for trainers, not AI coaching |

Nobody has: AI personality + async video review + curated trainer network + Asia focus.

---

## Next Steps

1. **30-minute call** - I walk you through the tech, you ask questions
2. **Brain dump session** - 2 hours, I capture your coaching methodology
3. **MVP build** - 4-6 weeks, I build while you continue normal work
4. **Beta launch** - Test with your audience, iterate
5. **Go live** - Start generating revenue

---

## The Ask

I'm not asking for money. I'm asking for partnership.

- You: Expertise, audience, network, brand, ~5 hrs/week post-launch
- Me: Tech platform, engineering, operations, ongoing development

Let's build something that scales your impact from dozens of clients to thousands, while you work less and earn more.

Sound interesting? Let's talk.

*P.S. - I already have the AI framework built (draagon-ai). It has personality systems, memory, learning capabilities, and mobile app support. This isn't starting from zero - it's adapting proven tech to fitness. The hard part is already done.*
