ECOSYSTEM


How can we share the same memory across different apps?
Or do we want to share the actual behaviors by calling out to a central MCP for draagon-ai (or maybe this is an app itself called roxy?)
And then roxy-assistant can plugin roxy where roxy has all the memories and core behaviors
What about a roxy MCP for claude code?
What about a VS Code plugin where it's a coding assistant that can use the shared roxy MCP or memory?
In all of these scenarios how do local edits happen vs. MCP/API integrations on the central roxy application?  How does Claude handle this?
What if I want the running app to be able to make local changes to the system it's running on or in (file system, IDE, mobile device) 
  but also delegate out to the central Roxy where it can also make local changes on that system (if it's running on my pop-os-desktop for example)?
Should these just all be separate apps that can work together in the ecosystem using MCP?
How do they still all share and modify the same memories though, as that's where it gets powerful.  My personal "assistant" can be
  involved in any work I am doing or involved in any device or app, and have their specific personality and memory.
Even more interesting is how we do this in mixed ecosystem.  For example, if I license draagon-ai to my company CareMetx and setup
  a central system for them that stores knowledge about me and other users in the company, can I also plugin in my own personal assistant
  so I can have my personal memories and my personalized behavior profile?  

Do some research on this complex ecosystem and how best to architect this.  What are my options, what are the pros and cons.  

Here are a few more examples:

I have a local claude I use on my desktop to edit and change things, can I replace that with my own version that can do the same things
  as claude but it as my assistants personality and my memories and household memories?  and then on my work laptop, I can hook into 
  the work memories and also integrate my personal assistant?

AGENTIC

Where are the ReAct patterns?  I thought we had some fancy graph approach to doing it, where did that go?

VS CODE EXTENSIONS & DEVELOPMENT AGENTS (Research: 2025-12-28)

Given your background (AI/ML, self-hosted infrastructure, voice assistants, DevOps, Home Assistant)
and draagon-ai's cognitive architecture, here are the most impactful extensions to build.

MCP SERVER IMPLEMENTATION:

The MCP server can be implemented using the official SDK:
```python
# extensions/mcp-memory/src/draagon_ai_mcp_memory/server.py

from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import Tool, Resource, Prompt
from draagon_ai.memory import LayeredMemoryProvider
from draagon_ai.cognition import BeliefReconciliationService

server = Server("draagon-memory")

@server.tool("memory_store")
async def store_memory(content: str, scope: str, memory_type: str) -> dict:
    """Store content in cognitive memory."""
    provider = get_memory_provider()
    return await provider.store(
        content=content,
        scope=MemoryScope[scope],
        memory_type=MemoryType[memory_type],
    )

@server.tool("memory_search")
async def search_memory(query: str, scope: str = None, limit: int = 10) -> list:
    """Search cognitive memory semantically."""
    provider = get_memory_provider()
    return await provider.search(
        query=query,
        scope=MemoryScope[scope] if scope else None,
        limit=limit,
    )

@server.tool("beliefs_query")
async def query_beliefs(topic: str) -> list:
    """Get beliefs about a topic."""
    service = get_belief_service()
    return await service.get_beliefs_about(topic)

@server.resource("project://context")
async def get_project_context() -> str:
    """Current project context from memory."""
    # Query memory for project-level beliefs and recent decisions
    ...

@server.prompt("code-review-with-memory")
async def code_review_prompt(files: list[str]) -> str:
    """Code review prompt enhanced with project memory."""
    beliefs = await query_beliefs("code conventions")
    patterns = await query_beliefs("architectural patterns")
    return f"""
    Review the following code considering these established conventions:
    {format_beliefs(beliefs)}

    And these architectural patterns:
    {format_beliefs(patterns)}

    Files to review: {files}
    """
