## Year 2: Trainer Network Launch (Quarters 5-8)

### Q5 (Months 13-15): Platform Beta

**Mike's Direct Revenue continues + Trainer Network starts**

| Month | Mike MRR | Trainers | Trainer Client Rev | Network Rev (25%) |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 13 | $68,000 | 3 | $6,000 | $1,500 |
| 14 | $72,000 | 5 | $12,000 | $3,000 |

| **Network Rev** | $1,500 | $3,000 | $5,500 | $10,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | $69,500 | $75,000 | $80,500 | **$225,000** |
| **Costs** | | | | |
| Hosting | $2,500 | $2,800 | $3,000 | $8,300 |

| **Net Profit** | $45,400 | $49,200 | $52,900 | **$147,500** |

**Q5 Split:**

Mike's Direct ($215K): Doug 30% = $64,500, Mike 70% = $150,500
Network ($10K): Doug 50% = $5,000, Mike 50% = $5,000 (Mike already took his 20-30% from trainers)

| Partner | Direct | Network | Total |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| Doug | $64,500 | $5,000 | $69,500 |
| Mike | $150,500 | $5,000 | $155,500 |
| **Less Costs (50/50)** | -$38,750 | -$38,750 | |
| **Net** | **$30,750** | **$116,750** | |

Wait - let me redo this more clearly. Costs should come out first, then split.

---

### Revised Split Model

**How money flows:**

1. **Revenue comes in** (Mike's clients + Network)
2. **Operating costs paid** (hosting, staff, marketing)
3. **Profit split** based on revenue source

**Mike's Direct Clients:**
- Revenue after costs → 70% Mike, 30% Doug

**Network Revenue (platform fees after Mike's cut from trainers):**
- Revenue after costs → 50% Mike, 50% Doug

Let me redo Year 2 with this cleaner model:

**Profit Attribution by Source:**

| Source | Revenue | Cost Allocation | Profit | Doug (%) | Mike (%) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|----------|

**Year 2 Summary:**
| Partner | Annual Take |
|---------|-------------|
| Doug | $256,750 |
| Mike | $510,750 |

*Note: Mike earns more because 83% of revenue is from his direct coaching where he gets 70%.*

## Year 3: Platform Scale (Quarters 9-12)

Mike's direct coaching plateaus as he focuses on network curation. Network revenue grows significantly.

## Why Mike Earns More

Over 3 years: Mike $1.52M vs Doug $1.01M

**Year 1:** Equal (50/50) because it's all platform building, no direct coaching revenue attribution yet.

**Year 2-3:** Mike earns more because:
1. His direct coaching is 70/30 in his favor (he's doing the work)
2. His direct coaching is a larger share of early revenue
3. As network grows, it becomes more 50/50

**Long-term trajectory:** If network dominates (Year 4+), splits converge toward 50/50.

| $100K MRR | Month 16 | $125,000 | $372,500 |

**Initial investment recovered:** Month 5
**First $100K profit each:** Month 14 (Doug), Month 11 (Mike)

## Notes

1. **Costs are shared 50/50** regardless of revenue source - we're partners in the business
2. **Revenue split reflects work** - Mike does coaching (70%), I do tech (platform fees 50%)
3. **Hiring comes from operating costs** - neither partner absorbs personally
4. **Mike's time value** - his 70% on direct compensates for his content, coaching, audience
5. **Doug's tech equity** - 50% of platform ensures long-term upside as network scales

This model assumes Mike stays engaged. If he pulls back on direct coaching earlier, network revenue must compensate. If network grows faster, Doug's share improves.
