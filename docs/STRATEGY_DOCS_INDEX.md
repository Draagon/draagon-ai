## Primary Strategy Document

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **[REVISED_MASTER_STRATEGY.md](REVISED_MASTER_STRATEGY.md)** | **CURRENT** | The definitive strategy document. 53K-line agentic framework, tiered open source plan, $5-20M exit target. **Start here.** |

## Supporting Documents

### System Analysis

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [FULL_SYSTEM_COMPARISON.md](FULL_SYSTEM_COMPARISON.md) | Current | Corrected analysis showing 53K lines, 18 modules. Explains why Mem0/Zep are backends, not competitors. |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Current | Technical architecture documentation |
| [ARCHITECTURE_REVISED.md](ARCHITECTURE_REVISED.md) | Current | Updated architecture with layered memory |

### Product Strategy

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [KILLER_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md](KILLER_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md) | Valid | Analysis of product options. Recommends HIPAA Dev Memory as first product. |
| [HEALTHCARE_EXECUTIVE_REVIEW.md](HEALTHCARE_EXECUTIVE_REVIEW.md) | Valid | Critical CTO perspective on healthcare path. Realistic timeline assessment. |
| [ANGEL_INVESTOR_ANALYSIS.md](ANGEL_INVESTOR_ANALYSIS.md) | Valid | Investment thesis for different product paths. |

### Productivity & Symbiosis

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [HUMAN_AI_SYMBIOSIS_MODEL.md](HUMAN_AI_SYMBIOSIS_MODEL.md) | Valid | The 20-50x productivity model through human-AI collaboration. |
| [SYMBIOSIS_REALITY_CHECK.md](SYMBIOSIS_REALITY_CHECK.md) | Updated | Expert review of productivity claims. Confirms 20-50x is achievable. |
| [RECURSIVE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_ANALYSIS.md](RECURSIVE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_ANALYSIS.md) | Valid | Why recursive self-improvement doesn't work. Human-AI symbiosis is the answer. |

### Research & Background

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [PATHS_TO_SUCCESS.md](PATHS_TO_SUCCESS.md) | Updated | Research on solo founders, exit strategies, Mem0/Zep paths. Note: Exit valuations revised to $5-20M. |
| [COMPETITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md](COMPETITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md) | Deprecated | Incorrectly framed as memory comparison. Retained for Mem0/Zep technical research. See FULL_SYSTEM_COMPARISON.md instead. |
| [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) | Reference | Large ideas file with research notes. |

### Technical

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOTYPE_DESIGN.md](ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOTYPE_DESIGN.md) | **Current** | Prototype design with killer features vs nice-to-haves, test suite, 12-day plan. |
| [GOD_LEVEL_ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN.md](GOD_LEVEL_ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN.md) | Reference | Full architecture vision (some features deferred to Phase 2). |
| [REALITY_CHECK_AND_BUILD_PLAN.md](REALITY_CHECK_AND_BUILD_PLAN.md) | Updated | Deep code review. Build plan superseded by GOD_LEVEL_ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN. |
| [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) | Current | Testing documentation |

## Quick Reference

### The Core Facts

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Codebase** | 53,117 lines of Python |
| **Modules** | 18 major modules |
| **Unique Features** | Promptbreeder, Behavior Architect, Belief Reconciliation, Curiosity Engine |
| **Competitors** | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen (NOT Mem0/Zep) |
| **Productivity Gain** | 20-50x (not 10,000x) |
| **Exit Target** | $5-20M in 2-3 years |

### The Strategy in One Sentence

> **Open source the agentic framework foundation, keep self-evolution as the moat, position as "AI that builds itself."**

### The Tagline

> **"AI that builds itself."**

## Reading Order for New Context

1. **REVISED_MASTER_STRATEGY.md** - The complete current strategy
2. **FULL_SYSTEM_COMPARISON.md** - Why this is a framework, not a memory system
3. **REALITY_CHECK_AND_BUILD_PLAN.md** - Code review confirming features work + build priorities
4. **HUMAN_AI_SYMBIOSIS_MODEL.md** - The productivity vision
5. **SYMBIOSIS_REALITY_CHECK.md** - What's realistic
