"""Adapters for integrating draagon-ai with various applications.

This module is for reference adapter implementations that show how to
bridge draagon-ai's protocols with existing application services.

Adapters are app-specific and should be defined in the application code,
not in the draagon-ai core package. See the roxy-voice-assistant project
for examples of how to create adapters.
